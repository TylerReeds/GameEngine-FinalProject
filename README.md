Description of the game:
It is a strategic 2D tile-based action game where you travel through a series of procedurally generated levels while slaying enemies. Enemies will only move after you move, and you can undo or redo any action you perform, playing into the strategy of navigating these levels and surviving. The player can also remap their controls to fit their needs and desires best.
